# CCNA 201-300 Practice
A web-application I created to assist me with my studies for my CCNA 201-300 Exam. It was created with native HTML/CSS/JS.
It includes most of the questions from the CCNA module exams. My goal was to create a clean and fast interface, with the option to combine different module, randomized questions and instant feedback.
